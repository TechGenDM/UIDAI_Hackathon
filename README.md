# Aadhaar Enrollment Analysis for Inclusive Digital Governance

This project was developed as part of the UIDAI Data Hackathon 2026.
It analyzes Aadhaar enrollment data to uncover district-level patterns,
intra-state inequality, and service pressure for governance planning.

## Objectives
- Analyze Aadhaar enrollment patterns across age groups and regions
- Identify district-level enrollment concentration and inequality
- Derive governance-oriented metrics for decision support

## Dataset
- Source: UIDAI Aadhaar Enrollment Dataset (Open Government Data platform)
- Records: 1M+ enrollment entries
- Key columns: state, district, pincode, age groups

## Methodology
- Data consolidation and cleaning
- Feature engineering (total enrollment)
- Exploratory data analysis
- Derivation of district inequality and service pressure metrics

## Key Insights
- Aadhaar enrollment is highly concentrated at district level
- State-level averages mask local disparities
- High service-pressure districts require targeted infrastructure planning

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Note
This repository contains the analysis code used for the hackathon submission.
The final evaluation was based on a consolidated PDF report.
